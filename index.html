          I dont know where to start... and not even sure what I'm going to say
          and why I'm doing this. I think I understand your choices and must
          respect your decisions.

        <h2>
          <strong>Happy <span>? </span> Valentines Day</strong>

        <p class="pacifico large">
          I belive that we are (or should I say 'were') something special.
        </p>
        <p class="pacifico">
          This is not something I'm writing to bring back all the
          feelings....rather something for us to move forward and possible
          say.....
          <span> "It was good while it lasted ." </span>
          Maybe this is what it is, a consequence.... a hefty price of loosing a
          best friend: The comfort and The Warmth to my <span>soul</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="pacifico">
          I wish you to be extremely succesful and achieve all your lofty
          ambitions. Always Be who are and Be Yourself.

          <span> "This is what it is and everything is for our best."</span>
          The possibility of this being our last conversation hurts, however,
          atleast this might mark <span> 'The End' </span> that we are longing
          for.
        </p>
        <p class="pacifico">
          Goodbyes are not always a happy ending; sometimes they're just a way
          to say we're <span>moving on to something better.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="pacifico">
          Always follow your heart and believe in yourself. You are
          exceptionally talented and may you reach the greatest heights.
        </p>
        <p class="pacifico">
          All the very best for your NCC exam and final year of college. Have
          lots and lot of fun!!
